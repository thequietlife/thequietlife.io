<h1>My homelab journey</h1>
<p>My homelab journey started with virtual machines loaded onto an external hard drive (SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD 1TB). Here I was able to have a play with Kali and a raft of different versions of Windows.

<p>I moved onto a 2017 iMac that had been gifted to me by a family member. I use a neat Apple A1048 keyboard I found from a business that was moving. By using a bootable USB drive I installed Ubuntu. I then used VirtualBox to create virtual machines (VMs). I use the VMs for digging into suspicious SMS. I really like giving life to old tech. </p>

<p>My current set up is a mini lab. 

I had a clear idea of what I wanted it to look like and what I wanted to achieve - a physically small setup,
a space for my lab which was separate from the other devices in the house with VLANs.  VLANs are virtual ports that sit on top of the switchâ€™s physical ports. They let you connect devices to separate networks.

I used draw.io to mock it up and asked for feedback in the pilar discord group. I got great feedback on how to set up a temporary, low cost lab. Using a travel router to piggy back on my existing ASUS router. I bought a Netgear GS108E 8 port managed switch, two tiny Lenovo M910q desktop PCs and a few CAT 6 ethernet cables. </p>
<p>I have to admit building a homelab stayed on my To Do list for quite a while. It was a bit daunting to get started. What the heck do I start with? How do I use a switch to get VLANs set up?

I started with setting up the GL.iNet Slate AX 1800 travel router. I use the repeater method. I also set up VPN through the travel routerâ€™s admin panel.

Next was the switch. It wasnâ€™t all that scary setting up VLANs. A few YouTube videos, reading and re-reading the Netgear documentation. I configured VLANs on the switch and via LuCl, OpenWrt for the router. Now I have two separate networks to use for my tech playground.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s next? I might set up OPNsense and Proxmox.
One thing I will need to replace soon is the all-in-one router. Iâ€™ll add it to my Black Friday shopping list.

The mini lab took about one week to set up. I was determined to get it set up and not get too distracted or despondent when things didnâ€™t come together the first time. It was on my To Do list for too long and needed to just get done. Itâ€™s been great to â€˜raise the barâ€™ of my home network. But also get a win to build my confidence with doing something pretty technical.

<p>Tips: 

 <ul>
  <li>Take photos and notes along the way</li>
  <li>Getting away from the desk is a great way to mull over other ways to approach a problem</li>
  <li>Start small</li>
</ul></p>
